## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following installed on your machine:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v14 or above)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (comes with Node.js)
  
If you don't have them installed, follow the instructions provided in the links to set them up.

## Running the Project

The project requires both the frontend (Vite) and backend (Express) to run concurrently. Follow these steps to start the project:

### 1. Install the project dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### 2. Run the Express Server

In one terminal window, run the Express backend server:

```bash
npm run server
```

### 3. Run the Vite Development Server

In a separate terminal window, run the Vite frontend development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

The application will then be available at [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173)
